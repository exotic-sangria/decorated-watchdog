<!-- Reminders: -->
1. https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#module-glob - to more easily parse wildcard filepaths for watching, etc.
2. https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html - to register .stop and .join methods?
3. https://github.com/biesnecker/hachiko - the thing this is based on in part
